# RimMirK.dev
Backend of [RimMirK.dev](https://RimMirK.dev)

This website was put together quickly. I'm **not a frontend developer**, but since it's common to build personal websites entirely by yourself, I made the frontend myself - half of it with the help of ChatGPT.

I'm sharing the **source code purely out of interest**. Feel free to explore it, learn from it, or use parts of it.
